# here we describe our lambda function
functions:
  graphql: # function name
    handler: src/handler.main # where the actual code is located
    # to call our function from outside, we need to expose it to the outer world
    # in order to do so, we create a REST endpoint
    events:
      - http:
          path: graphql # path for the endpoint
          method: any # HTTP method for the endpoint, could be only 'post' or 'get', etc
          # cors: true

custom:
  webpack:
    webpackConfig: 'webpack.config.js' # name of webpack configuration file
    includeModules: true # add excluded modules to the bundle
    packager: 'npm' # package manager we use
